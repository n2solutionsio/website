      I&apos;m a builder at heart &mdash; always tinkering, always shipping. By
      day I work in platform engineering and DevOps. After hours, I&apos;m deep
      in homelab projects, open source builds, and figuring out what to automate
      next. When I need to unplug, you&apos;ll find me on the water, on two
      wheels, or in the stands watching Philly do its thing.
