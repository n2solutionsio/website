## The Beginning

Every journey starts somewhere. This one starts with a commit.

I've been tinkering with infrastructure, automation, and cloud-native tools for a while now — but mostly behind closed doors. Homelab experiments, late-night Terraform sessions, Raspberry Pi clusters that may or may not have caught fire (figuratively). It's time to start sharing the process.

## Why Build in Public?

There's something powerful about working in the open. It forces you to think clearly, document your decisions, and ship things that actually work. It also creates a trail — for others to learn from, and for future-me to look back on.

This blog will cover:

- **Platform Engineering** — building internal developer platforms, tooling, and workflows
- **DevOps & IaC** — Terraform, OpenTofu, Terragrunt, Ansible, and everything in between
- **Homelab Builds** — Proxmox, Kubernetes, Docker, self-hosted everything
- **Cloud-Native** — AWS, containers, CI/CD pipelines, and microservices
- **Security** — because if you're not thinking about it, someone else is
- **The Journey** — the honest, unfiltered process of building a brand and shipping projects

## What's Next

The site you're reading this on is the first project. Built with Astro, React, and Tailwind CSS. Hosted on AWS. Managed with OpenTofu. Every piece of it will be documented and open source.

Stay tuned. This is just the beginning.
